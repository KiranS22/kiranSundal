## Final IT Career Switch Projects

### Portfolio Project #1: Gazetteer

The first portfolio project, "Gazetteer," involved creating a map-based app to provide information on countries, with a specific focus on a "mobile-first" development approach. The project required the use of a framework to develop HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with JQuery modules, incorporating PHP server-based components to fetch data from third-party APIs such as Geonames and OpenWeather. The success of the solution was assessed based on its adherence to the specifications, functionality, and usability.

**What I enjoyed?**
During this project, I had the opportunity to learn and work with Leafletjs, along with cluster marker and extra marker libraries.

**What I struggled with?**
I faced challenges while locating and including all the necessary files to run Leafletjs without encountering errors in the console. Additionally, debugging issues arose when utilizing free API services, as there were limitations on the number of requests that could be made to the server.

**What I would improve?**
Given the chance to improve my Gazeteer project, I would implement the following enhancements:

- Incorporate an overlay at the bottom of the page to display images of the selected country.
- Add markers for airports in each country for improved user navigation.
- Revise the color scheme to create a more cohesive and uniform design.

### Portfolio Project #2: Company Directory

The second portfolio project, "Company Directory," demanded a more comprehensive approach as it necessitated the creation of a user requirements document. The project could only progress once the document was approved, which then triggered the release of SQL to develop a "mobile-first" application for maintaining a company personnel database using MySQL.

**What I enjoyed?**
Throughout this project, I particularly enjoyed writing MySQL queries to manipulate the database and creating the user interface.

**What I struggled with?**
The challenge in this project came from managing a mix of Bootstrap and custom CSS. This resulted in the interface behaving differently at times due to occasional style conflicts.

**What I would improve?**
To enhance this project further, I would introduce a filtering feature that allows users to find employees based on either their location or department.

These projects marked significant milestones in my IT career switch journey, providing valuable learning experiences and opportunities for growth.
